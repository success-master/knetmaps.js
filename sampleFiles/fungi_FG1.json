Overproduction of Vac17 increases deposition of aggregates into cytoprotective vacuole-associated sites,  counteracts age-related breakdown of endocytosis and vacuole integrity,  and extends replicative lifespan. The link between damage asymmetry and vesicle trafficking can be explained by a direct interaction between aggregates and vesicles. We also show that the protein disaggregase Hsp104 interacts physically with endocytic vesicle-associated proteins,  such as the dynamin-like protein,  Vps1,  which was also shown to be required for Vac17-dependent sequestration of protein aggregates. These data demonstrate that two physiognomies of aging-reduced endocytosis and protein aggregation-are interconnected and regulated by Vac17.

One hallmark of most cancers that can be exploited by chemotherapies is chromosome instability (CIN). Because chromosome replication,  maintenance,  and segregation represent conserved and cell-essential processes,  they can be modeled effectively in simpler eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we analyze and extend genetic networks of CIN cancer gene orthologs in yeast,  focusing on essential genes. This identifies hub genes and processes that are candidate targets for synthetic lethal killing of cancer cells with defined somatic mutations. One hub process in these networks is DNA replication. A nonessential,  fork-associated scaffold,  CTF4,  is among the most highly connected genes. As Ctf4 lacks enzymatic activity,  potentially limiting its development as a therapeutic target,  we exploited its function as a physical interaction hub to rationally predict synthetic lethal interactions between essential Ctf4-binding proteins and CIN cancer gene orthologs. We then validated a subset of predicted genetic interactions in a human colorectal cancer cell line,  showing that siRNA-mediated knockdown of MRE11A sensitizes cells to depletion of various replication fork-associated proteins. Overall,  this work describes methods to identify,  predict,  and validate in cancer cells candidate therapeutic targets for tumors with known somatic mutations in CIN genes using data from yeast. We affirm not only replication stress but also the targeting of DNA replication fork proteins themselves as potential targets for anticancer therapeutic development.

Loss of all six tethering proteins results in the separation of the ER from the PM and the accumulation of cytoplasmic ER.

The second suppressor mutation required is either slu1 or slu2 (suppressor of lanosterol utilization). These mutations are leaky versions of HEM2 and HEM4,  respectively; addition of exogenous hemin reverses the suppressing effects of slu1 and slu2. Suppression of erg25 by erg11 slu1 (or erg11 slu2) results in a slow-growing strain in which lanosterol,  the first sterol in the pathway,  accumulates.

Their known genome sequences enabled several transcriptomic profiling studies under many different environmental conditions,  thus mimicking not only perturbations and adaptations which occur in their natural surroundings,  but also in industrial processes. Notably,  the majority of such transcriptome analyses were performed using non-engineered strains.In this comparative study,  the gene expression profiles of S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris,  a Crabtree positive and Crabtree negative yeast,  respectively,  were analyzed for three different oxygenation conditions (normoxic,  oxygen-limited and hypoxic) under recombinant protein producing conditions in chemostat cultivations. The major differences in the transcriptomes of S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris were observed between hypoxic and normoxic conditions,  where the availability of oxygen strongly affected ergosterol biosynthesis,  central carbon metabolism and stress responses,  particularly the unfolded protein response. Steady state conditions under low oxygen set-points seemed to perturb the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae to a much lesser extent than the one of P. pastoris,  reflecting the major tolerance of the baker's yeast towards oxygen limitation,  and a higher fermentative capacity. Further important differences were related to Fab production,  which was not significantly affected by oxygen availability in S. cerevisiae,  while a clear productivity increase had been previously reported for hypoxically grown P. pastoris. The effect of three different levels of oxygen availability on the physiology of P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae revealed a very distinct remodelling of the transcriptional program,  leading to novel insights into the different adaptive responses of Crabtree negative and positive yeasts to oxygen availability.

Classic studies have identified core pseudohyphal growth signaling modules in yeast; however,  the scope of regulatory networks that control yeast filamentation is broad and incompletely defined. Here,  we address the genetic basis of yeast pseudohyphal growth by implementing a systematic analysis of 4909 genes for overexpression phenotypes in a filamentous strain of S. cerevisiae. Our results identify 551 genes conferring exaggerated invasive growth upon overexpression under normal vegetative growth conditions. This cohort includes 79 genes lacking previous phenotypic characterization. Pathway enrichment analysis of the gene set identifies networks mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cell cycle progression. In particular,  overexpression screening suggests that nuclear export of the osmoresponsive MAPK Hog1p may enhance pseudohyphal growth. The function of nuclear Hog1p is unclear from previous studies,  but our analysis using a nuclear-depleted form of Hog1p is consistent with a role for nuclear Hog1p in repressing pseudohyphal growth. Through epistasis and deletion studies,  we also identified genetic relationships with the G2 cyclin Clb2p and phenotypes in filamentation induced by S-phase arrest.

This transcriptional response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to osmotic shock encompasses genes whose products are implicated in protection from oxidative damage. We addressed the question of whether osmotic shock caused oxidative stress. Osmotic shock did not result in the generation of detectable levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To preclude any generation of ROS,  osmotic shock treatments were performed in anaerobic cultures. Global gene expression response profiles were compared by employing a novel two-dimensional cluster analysis. The transcriptional profiles following osmotic shock under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were qualitatively very similar. In particular,  it appeared that expression of the oxidative stress genes was stimulated upon osmotic shock even if there was no apparent need for their function. Interestingly,  cells adapted to osmotic shock much more rapidly under anaerobiosis,  and the signaling as well as the transcriptional response was clearly attenuated under these conditions. This more rapid adaptation is due to an enhanced glycerol production capacity in anaerobic cells,  which is caused by the need for glycerol production in redox balancing.

Extrapolating these data through a computational algorithm employing Bayesian formalism,  we define the yeast localizome (the subcellular distribution of all 6100 yeast proteins).

In yeast,  treatment with lovastatin results in reduced growth. We combined lovastatin with the library of metabolites,  and found that copper and zinc ions impaired the ability of the statin to inhibit yeast growth. Using an integrated genomic and metabolomic approach,  we found that lovastatin plus metal synergistically upregulated some sterol biosynthesis genes.

Yeast chemogenomic profiling is a powerful approach for annotating cellular responses to small molecules.

The data quality enables unique insights into pathways that are sensitive and resistant to a given perturbation,  as demonstrated with both known and novel compounds. We present examples of novel compounds that inhibit the therapeutically relevant fatty acid synthase and desaturase (Fas1p and Ole1p),  and demonstrate how the individual profiles facilitate hypothesis-driven experiments to delineate compound mechanism of action. Importantly,  the scale and diversity of tested compounds yields a dataset where the number of modulated pathways approaches saturation. This resource can be used to map novel biological connections,  and also identify functions for unannotated genes. We validated hypotheses generated by global two-way hierarchical clustering of profiles for (i) novel compounds with a similar mechanism of action acting upon microtubules or vacuolar ATPases,  and (ii) an un-annotated ORF,  YIL060w,  that plays a role in respiration in the mitochondria. Finally,  we identify and characterize background mutations in the widely used yeast deletion collection which should improve the interpretation of past and future screens throughout the community.

Our approach correctly identifies previously described chemical-genetic interactions,  as well as a new mechanism of suppressing fluconazole toxicity by repression of the ERG25 gene. Assessment of multiple target loci across treatments using gRNA libraries allows us to determine generalizable features associated with gRNA efficacy. Guides that target regions with low nucleosome occupancy and high chromatin accessibility are clearly more effective. We also find that the best region to target gRNAs is between the transcription start site (TSS) and 200 bp upstream of the TSS. Finally,  unlike nuclease-proficient Cas9 in human cells,  the specificity of truncated gRNAs (18 nt of complementarity to the target) is not clearly superior to full-length gRNAs (20 nt of complementarity),  as truncated gRNAs are generally less potent against both mismatched and perfectly matched targets. Our results establish a powerful functional and chemical genomics screening method and provide guidelines for designing effective gRNAs,  which consider chromatin state and position relative to the target gene TSS.

To investigate its localization and the localization mechanism(s),  we constructed a chimera by inserting a 30-residue segment,  Leu(283)-Leu(312) of P450-CYP51 containing a potential N-glycosylation site in the cytoplasmic region,  into the N-terminus of the same protein and tagging the C-terminus with three repeats of a hemagglutinin epitope.

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that this chimera is localized exclusively to the ER when it is expressed on either a single-copy or multicopy vector. We carried out pulse-chase experiments and found that this chimera,  when expressed on a multicopy plasmid,  gradually undergoes alpha1-->6 glycosylation,  a cis-Golgi-specific modification,  but not alpha1-->;3 glycosylation,  a medial Golgi-specific modification. In contrast,  a single-copy expression of this chimera does not lead to the cis-Golgi-specific modification. These findings suggest that,  when expressed on a multicopy plasmid,  a fraction of this chimera is transported from the ER to the cis-Golgi compartment and subsequently recycled to the ER,  but when expressed on a single-copy plasmid,  no significant transport of this protein from the ER takes place.

From the analysis of the improved expression constructs five conclusions could be reached:  (1) expression from the native 14DM gene is comparable to the expression driven by the TDH3 promoter-14DM fusion construct on single copy plasmid vectors; (2) expression from the TDH3 promoter-14DM construct on single-copy vectors is nearly as efficient as expression from the corresponding endogenous TDH3 gene; (3) the gene copy number has an effect on the relative expression levels of the TDH3 promoter-14DM constructs; (4) the steady-state amounts of protein produced are very nearly proportional to gene dosage; and (5) protein toxicity does not have a major impact on 14DM production. The maximum yield of 14DM was in the order of 7% of the total yeast protein and the maximum production of functional 14DM heme protein appears to be limited by the availability of heme.

Upon shifting cells to anaerobic conditions in galactose medium,  there was an acute ( approximately 10 min) yet transient (<45 min) induction of Msn2- and\/or Msn4-regulated genes associated with the remodeling of reserve energy and catabolic pathways during the switch from mixed respiro-fermentative to strictly fermentative growth. Concomitantly,  MCB- and SCB-regulated networks associated with the G(1)\/S transition of the cell cycle were transiently down-regulated along with rRNA processing genes containing PAC and RRPE motifs. Remarkably,  none of these gene networks were differentially expressed when cells were shifted in glucose,  suggesting that a metabolically derived signal arising from the abrupt cessation of respiration,  rather than O(2) deprivation per se,  elicits this \"stress response.\" By approximately 0.2 generation of anaerobiosis in both media,  more chronic,  heme-dependent effects were observed,  including the down-regulation of Hap1-regulated networks,  derepression of Rox1-regulated networks,  and activation of Upc2-regulated ones. Changes in these networks result in the functional remodeling of the cell wall,  sterol and sphingolipid metabolism,  and dissimilatory pathways required for long-term anaerobiosis.

Two transformants strongly expressed the LAN14DM as shown by Northern and Western experiments. These transgenic calli were killed by LAB 170250F (LAB) (a phytotoxic fungicide inhibiting both plant obtusifoliol-14-demethylase (OBT14DM) and LAN14DM) but were resistant to gamma-ketotriazole (gamma-kt),  a herbicide which has been shown to inhibit OBT14DM but not LAN14DM at a concentration that was lethal to control calli. However,  these transgenic calli were killed by mixtures of gamma-kt plus fungicide inhibitors of LAN14DM such as ketoconazole,  itraconazole or flusilazole which alone were not effective. Further analysis of the transgenic calli grown in the presence of gamma-kt showed that their delta 5-sterol content was close to that of untreated control calli obtained from protoplasts transformed with control plasmid; this is in agreement with evidence that the LAN14DM expressed from the transgene could bypass the blocked OBT14DM by using the plant substate obtusifoliol.

Candida glabrata is known to be less susceptible to fluconazole than most Candida albicans strains,  and the incidence of C. glabrata infection has been increasing mostly in conjunction with the use of azole antifungals. Recently,  it has been reported that C. glabrata can rescue the defect of ergosterol biosynthesis by incorporating cholesterol from serum. To explore the effect of inactivating Erg11p in C. glabrata,  we generated mutant strains in which the ERG11 gene was placed under the control of tetracycline-regulatable promoters. In these mutants,  expression of the ERG11 gene can be repressed by doxycycline (DOX). All mutants showed a growth defect in the presence of DOX. The numbers of CFU of the mutants were lowered by only 1\/10 with DOX treatment. In these mutants,  accumulation of 4, 14-dimethylzymosterol,  which differs from an accumulated abnormal sterol detected in C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae treated with fluconazole,  was observed by DOX treatment. Although such phenotypes were also observed in serum-containing media by DOX treatment,  they were alleviated. Furthermore,  the mutant could grow in DOX-treated mice without a severe reduction in the number of cells. Thus,  depleting the expression of the ERG11 gene lowered the number of CFU by only 1\/10 due to the accumulation of 4, 14-demethylzymosterol in vitro,  and it did not result in the defective growth of fungal cells in mice.

Several features of the protein,  deduced from the sequence of the gene,  suggest that CYP1 is a general sensor of the redox state of the cell. To investigate further the function of CYP1,  we analysed its effects on the transcription of two genes,  HEM13 and 14DM,  which are preferentially expressed in anaerobiosis. HEM13 encodes coproporphyrinogen oxidase which catalyses the sixth enzymatic step in the heme biosynthetic pathway and 14DM encodes lanosterol-14-demethylase which is involved in sterol biosynthesis and is a member of the cytochrome P450 family. Isogenic CYP1+ and cyp1 degree deleted strains,  either heme-sufficient or heme-deficient (HEM1 disrupted),  were grown in aerobic or anaerobic conditions,  and transcripts of HEM13 and 14DM were analysed on Northern blots. The results show that in anaerobic and in heme-deficient cells,  CYP1 activates the transcription of HEM13 and inhibits that of 14DM. Opposite effects of CYP1 are observed in aerobic,  heme-sufficient cells. We concluded that:  (i) CYP1 is an efficient activator especially in heme-depleted cells; (ii) CYP1 exerts both positive and negative regulatory effects; (iii) the nature of the regulatory function of CYP1 depends on the target gene; and (iv) for a given gene,  the presence or absence of heme or oxygen reverses the sense of CYP1-dependent regulation.

The main differences in the transcriptome were observed in the comparison of fully aerobic,  intermediate oxygen and anaerobic conditions,  while the transcriptome was generally unchanged in conditions receiving different intermediate levels (0.5,  1.0 or 2.8% O2) of oxygen in the feed gas. Comparison of the transcriptome and proteome data suggested post-transcriptional regulation was important,  especially in 0.5% oxygen. In the conditions of intermediate oxygen,  the genes encoding enzymes of the respiratory pathway were more highly expressed than in either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. A similar trend was also seen in the proteome and in enzyme activities of the TCA cycle. Further,  genes encoding proteins of the mitochondrial translation machinery were present at higher levels in all oxygen-limited and anaerobic conditions,  compared to fully aerobic conditions. Global upregulation of genes encoding components of the respiratory pathway under conditions of intermediate oxygen suggested a regulatory mechanism to control these genes as a response to the need of more efficient energy production. Further,  cells grown in three different intermediate oxygen levels were highly similar at the level of transcription,  while they differed at the proteome level,  suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to distinct physiological modes of respiro-fermentative metabolism.

To test this hypothesis,  we constructed mutants with disruptions in UPC2A and UPC2B alone and in combination in a matched pair of clinical azole-SDD and -resistant isolates. Disruption of UPC2A in both the SDD and resistant isolates resulted in increased susceptibility to sterol biosynthesis inhibitors,  including a reduction in fluconazole MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration,  enhanced azole activity by time-kill analysis,  a decrease in ergosterol content,  and downregulation of baseline and inducible expression of several sterol biosynthesis genes.

Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1,  NPR1,  PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth,  and their expression is upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22\/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore,  ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors Sut1 and Sut2.

We present evidence that azole activity versus Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also modulated by Ca2+-regulated signalling. (i) Azole activity was reduced by the addition of Ca2+. Conversely,  azole activity was enhanced by the addition of Ca2+ chelator EGTA. (ii) Three structurally distinct inhibitors (fluphenazine,  calmidazolium and a W-7 analogue) of the Ca2+-binding regulatory protein calmodulin enhanced azole activity.

(v) CRZ1\/TCN1 encodes a transcription factor regulated by calcineurin phosphatase; its disruption enhanced azole sensitivity,  whereas its overexpression decreased azole sensitivity.

To understand the range of mechanisms by which yeasts can respond to anti-fungals,  we compared gene expression patterns across three evolutionarily distant species - Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  Candida glabrata and Kluyveromyces lactis - over time following fluconazole exposure. Conserved and diverged expression patterns were identified using a novel soft clustering algorithm that concurrently clusters data from all species while incorporating sequence orthology. The analysis suggests complementary strategies for coping with ergosterol depletion by azoles - Saccharomyces imports exogenous ergosterol,  Candida exports fluconazole,  while Kluyveromyces does neither,  leading to extreme sensitivity. In support of this hypothesis we find that only Saccharomyces becomes more azole resistant in ergosterol-supplemented media; that this depends on sterol importers Aus1 and Pdr11; and that transgenic expression of sterol importers in Kluyveromyces alleviates its drug sensitivity. We have compared the dynamic transcriptional responses of three diverse yeast species to fluconazole treatment using a novel clustering algorithm. This approach revealed significant divergence among regulatory programs associated with fluconazole sensitivity.

Management of fungal infections is markedly limited by problems of drug safety,  resistance and effectiveness profile. Current therapy for invasive mycoses uses a relatively reduced number of antifungal drugs,  such as amphotericin B,  fluconazole and itraconazole. Other new antifungal agents from old and new chemical families,  like voriconazole,  posaconazole,  ravuconazole,  caspofungin and micafungin,  have been introduced into the armamentarium for fungal infections management. This review is focused on the mode of action of those antifungal drugs used against pathogenic yeasts. The interaction of amphotericin B with ergosterol and other membrane sterols results in the production of aqueous pores of drug and the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway is the target of the allylamines,  phenylmorpholines and azole antifungal agents. The main molecular target of azole antifungals is the cytochrome P-450 protein Erg11p\/Cyp51p. Echinocandins,  a new class of antifungal drugs,  are fungal secondary metabolites that act against beta-1-3-D-glucan synthesis. The phenylmorpholines,  of which amorolfine is the sole representative in human therapy,  affect two targets in the ergosterol pathway:  Erg24p (delta 14 reductase) and Erg2p (delta 8-delta 7 isomerase). The sordarins group are protein synthesis inhibitors that work by blocking the function of fungal translation elongation factor 2. Other protein inhibitors are zofimarin,  BE31045,  SCH57504,  xylarin,  hypoxysordarin and GR135402. In order to overcome the problems derived from the exploitation of azole drugs,  macrolides and echinocandins,  novel targets were explored. Proposed antifungal drugs have been developed against potential targets like the N-myristylation of fungal proteins,  with inhibitors like myristate and histidine analogues or myristoylpeptide derivatives,  aminobenzothiazoles,  quinolines and benzofurans. Polymerization of cell wall carbohydrates from uridine di-phospho sugars is another potential target.

Therefore,  the proteomic response of S. cerevisiae to anaerobiosis was investigated using metabolic stable-isotope labelling in aerobic and anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures,  followed by relative quantification of protein expression. Using independent replicate cultures and stringent statistical filtering,  a robust dataset of 474 quantified proteins was generated,  of which 249 showed differential expression levels.

The use of chemostat cultures provided well-controlled and reproducible culture conditions,  which are essential for generating robust datasets at different cellular information levels.

In this work we present a study of the genetic diversity observed in genes from these pathways.

Based on this analysis we obtained the complete sequence of the ortholog of the yeast ERG26 gene and identified a non-orthologous homolog of the yeast ERG25 gene (sterol methyl oxidase,  SMO),  and we propose that the orthologs of ERG25 have been lost in trypanosomes (but not in Leishmanias). Next,  starting from a set of 16 T. cruzi strains representative of all extant evolutionary lineages,  we amplified and sequenced ? 24 Kbp from 22 genes,  identifying a total of 975 SNPs or fixed differences,  of which 28% represent non-synonymous changes. We observed genes with a density of substitutions ranging from those close to the average (? 2.5\/100 bp) to some showing a high number of changes (11.4\/100 bp,  for the putative lathosterol oxidase gene). All the genes of the pathway are under apparent purifying selection,  but genes coding for the sterol C14-demethylase,  the HMG-CoA synthase,  and the HMG-CoA reductase have the lowest density of missense SNPs in the panel. Other genes (TcPMK,  TcSMO-like) have a relatively high density of non-synonymous SNPs (2.5 and 1.9 every 100 bp,  respectively). However,  none of the non-synonymous changes identified affect a catalytic or ligand binding site residue.

Applying the test to genome-wide gene expression data from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  we find that hundreds of gene expression levels have been subject to lineage-specific selection. Comparing these findings with independent population genetic evidence of selective sweeps suggests that this lineage-specific selection has resulted in recent sweeps at over a hundred genes,  most of which led to increased transcript levels. Examination of the implicated genes revealed a specific biochemical pathway--ergosterol biosynthesis--where the expression of multiple genes has been subject to selection for reduced levels.

(1997) Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 230,  381-385]. Wheat and sorghum CYP51 proteins show a high identity (92%) compared with their identity with their fungal and mammalian orthologues (32-39%). Data obtained with plant microsomes have previously suggested that differences in primary sequences reflect differences in sterol pathways and CYP51 substrate specificities between animals,  fungi and plants. To investigate more thoroughly the properties of the plant CYP51,  the wheat enzyme was expressed in yeast strains overexpressing different P450 reductases as a fusion with either yeast or plant (sorghum) membrane targeting sequences. The endogenous sterol demethylase gene (ERG11) was then disrupted. A sorghum-wheat fusion protein expressed with the Arabidopsis thaliana reductase ATR1 showed the highest level of expression and activity. The expression induced a marked proliferation of microsomal membranes so as to obtain 70 nmol P450.(L culture)-1,  with CYP51 representing 1.5% of microsomal protein. Without disruption of the ERG11 gene,  the expression level was fivefold reduced. CYP51 from wheat complemented the ERG11 disruption,  as the modified yeasts did not need supplementation with exogenous ergosterol and grew normally under aerobic conditions. The fusion plant enzyme catalysed 14alpha-demethylation of obtusifoliol very actively (Km, app = 197 microm,  kcat = 1.2 min-1) and with very strict substrate specificity. No metabolism of lanosterol and eburicol,  the substrates of the fungal and mammalian CYP51s,  nor metabolism of herbicides and fatty acids was detected in the recombinant yeast microsomes. Surprisingly lanosterol (Ks = 2.2 microM) and eburicol (Ks = 2.5 microm) were found to bind the active site of the plant enzyme with affinities higher than that for obtusifoliol (Ks = 289 microM),  giving typical type-I spectra. The amplitudes of these spectra,  however,  suggested that lanosterol and eburicol were less favourably positioned to be metabolized than obtusifoliol. The recombinant enzyme was also used to test the relative binding constants of two azole compounds,  LAB170250F and gamma-ketotriazole,  which were previously reported to be potent inhibitors of the plant enzyme. The Ks of plant CYP51 for LAB170250F (0.29 microM) and gamma-ketotriazole (0.40 microM) calculated from the type-II sp2 nitrogen-binding spectra were in better agreement with their reported effects as plant CYP51 inhibitors than values previously determined with plant microsomes. This optimized expression system thus provides an excellent tool for detailed enzymological and mechanistic studies,  and for improving the selectivity of inhibitory molecules.

While mutants defective in vacuole fusion are \"wild type\" for vegetative growth,  most have shortened replicative lifespans under caloric restriction (CR) condition,  a manipulation that extends lifespan in wild type cells. To explore whether vacuole fusion extends lifespan,  we screened for genes that can complement the fusion defect of selected mutants (erg6?,  a sterol mutant; nyv1?,   a mutant involved in the vacuolar SNARE complex and vac8?,  a vacuolar membrane protein mutant). This screen revealed that Osh6,  a member of the oxysterol-binding protein family,  can complement the vacuole fusion defect of nyv1?,  but not erg6? or vac8?,  suggesting that Osh6's function in vacuole fusion is partly dependent on membrane ergosterol and Vac8. To measure the effect of OSH6 on lifespan,  we replaced the endogenous promoter of OSH6 with a shorter version of the ERG6 promoter to obtain PERG6-OSH6. This mutant construct significantly extended the replicative lifespan in a wild type background and in a nyv1? mutant. Interestingly,  PERG6-OSH6 cells were more sensitive to drugs that inhibit the activity of the TOR complex 1 (TORC1) than wild type cells. Moreover,  a PERG6-OSH6 tor1? double mutant demonstrated a greatly shortened lifespan,  suggesting a genetic interaction between Osh6 and Tor1. Since active TORC1 stimulates vacuole scission and CR downregulates TORC1,  Osh6 may link these two pathways by adjusting vacuolar membrane organization to extend lifespan.

It is found that the endogenous substrate,  lanosterol,  can readily occupy the putative active site of the CYP51 model such that the known mono-oxygenation reaction,  leading to C14-demethylation of lanosterol,  is the preferred route of metabolism for this particular substrate. Key amino acid contacts within the CYP51 active site appear to orientate lanosterol for oxidative attack at the C14-methyl group,  and the position of the substrate relative to the haem moiety is consistent with the phenyl-iron complexation studies reported by Tuck et al. [J. Biol. Chem.,  267,  13175-13179 (1992)].

The amino acid identity value between given pairs of P45014DMs ranged from 93% (human\/rat) to 39% (human or rat\/Saccharomyces cerevisiae). All the P45014DMs formed a single cluster in a phylogenetic tree constructed from representative P450 protein sequences currently available. The nearest neighbors to the P45014DM cluster in the phylogenetic tree were CYP7 (cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase) and CYP8 (prostacyclin synthase),  and the divergence point of fungal and mammalian P45014DMs was clearly more recent than that of P45014DM and CYP7\/CYP8.

The repressive activity of Hap1 controls several genes,  including three ERG genes required for ergosterol biosynthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Hap1 binds to the ERG gene promoters,  while additional experiments showed that the corepressor Tup1\/Ssn6 is recruited by Hap1 and is also required for repression. Furthermore,  mutational analysis demonstrated that conserved Hap1 binding sites in the ERG5 5' regulatory region are required for repression. The switch of Hap1 from acting as a hypoxic repressor to an aerobic activator is determined by heme,  which is synthesized only in the presence of oxygen. The ability of Hap1 to function as a ligand-dependent repressor and activator is a property shared with mammalian nuclear hormone receptors and likely allows greater transcriptional control by Hap1 in response to changing oxygen levels.

In yeast cells,  a limited number of genes are located on mitochondrial DNA. Although the mechanisms underlying nuclear genome maintenance are well understood,  much less is known about the mechanisms that ensure mitochondrial genome stability. Mitochondria influence the stability of the nuclear genome and vice versa. Little is known about the two-way communication and mutual influence of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Although the mitochondrial genome replicates independent of the nuclear genome and is organized by a distinct set of mitochondrial nucleoid proteins,  nearly all genome stability mechanisms responsible for maintaining the nuclear genome,  such as mismatch repair,  base excision repair,  and double-strand break repair via homologous recombination or the nonhomologous end-joining pathway,  also act to protect mitochondrial DNA. In addition to mitochondria-specific DNA polymerase ?,  the polymerases ?,  ?,  ?,  and Rev1 have been found in this organelle. A nuclear genome instability phenotype results from a failure of various mitochondrial functions,  such as an electron transport chain activity breakdown leading to a decrease in ATP production,  a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (??),  and a block in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. The loss of ?? inhibits the production of iron-sulfur prosthetic groups,  which impairs the assembly of Fe-S proteins,  including those that mediate DNA transactions; disturbs iron homeostasis; leads to oxidative stress; and perturbs wobble tRNA modification and ribosome assembly,  thereby affecting translation and leading to proteotoxic stress.

To reveal principles by which promoter sequence regulates burst size and frequency,  we randomly mutated 22 yeast promoters chosen to span a range of expression and noise levels,  generating libraries of hundreds of sequence variants. In each library,  mean expression (m) and noise (coefficient of variation,  ?) varied together,  defining a scaling curve:  ?(2) = b\/m + ?(ext)(2). This relation is expected if sequence mutations modulate burst frequency primarily. The estimated burst size (b) differed between promoters,  being higher in promoter containing a TATA box and lacking a nucleosome-free region. The rare variants that significantly decreased b were explained by mutations in TATA,  or by an insertion of an out-of-frame translation start site. The decrease in burst size due to mutations in TATA was promoter-dependent,  but independent of other mutations. These TATA box mutations also modulated the responsiveness of gene expression to changing conditions.

We therefore developed an algorithm that is based on hypothesis-driven data analysis to uncover the transcriptional regulatory architecture of metabolic networks. By using information on the metabolic network topology from genome-scale metabolic reconstruction,  we show that it is possible to reveal patterns in the metabolic network that follow a common transcriptional response. Thus,  the algorithm enables identification of so-called reporter metabolites (metabolites around which the most significant transcriptional changes occur) and a set of connected genes with significant and coordinated response to genetic or environmental perturbations. We find that cells respond to perturbations by changing the expression pattern of several genes involved in the specific part(s) of the metabolism in which a perturbation is introduced.

The complex was disrupted by high-salt concentration,  reflecting the importance of electrostatic forces in the protein-protein interaction. The results demonstrate the membrane anchor serves to localize Erg11p to the ER where the substrate is located,  but is not essential in either Ncpr1p or Erg11p activity. The possibility of cocrystallization of an active soluble eukaryotic 14 alpha-demethylase can be envisaged.

In particular,  the P450 enzyme,  lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase,  has been implicated as the target of azole antifungal drugs that have potent anti-T. cruzi activity. In the work reported here,  the T. cruzi lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase (Tc14DM) gene was cloned by degenerate PCR. The gene was found to be expressed in both insect and mammalian life-cycle stages of the parasite. Tc14DM was able to complement the function of the homologous gene in yeast (erg11) as demonstrated by restored ergosterol production in an erg11-deficient yeast strain. When the yeast strain was co-transfected with the P450 reductase gene from Trypanosoma brucei,  the amount of ergosterol production was increased,  indicating that the endogenous yeast P450 reductase was an inefficient partner with Tc14DM. Heterologous expression of Tc14DM in the baculovirus\/Sf9 system resulted in a 52kDa product. The protein was observed to have the characteristic absorbance spectra of a P450 enzyme.

In this study,  the CYP51 gene from X. dendrorhous was isolated and its function was analyzed. The gene is composed of ten exons and encodes a predicted 550 amino acid polypeptide that exhibits conserved cytochrome P450 structural characteristics and shares significant identity with the sterol C14-demethylase from other fungi. The functionality of this gene was confirmed by heterologous complementation in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore,  a CYP51 gene mutation in X. dendrorhous reduced sterol production by approximately 40% and enhanced total carotenoid production by approximately 90% compared to the wild-type strain after 48 and 120 h of culture,  respectively. Additionally,  the CYP51 gene mutation in X. dendrorhous increased HMGR (hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase,  involved in the mevalonate pathway) and crtR (cytochrome P450 reductase) transcript levels,  which could be associated with reduced ergosterol production.

Sequence analysis of this C. albicans UPC2 (CaUPC2) gene identifies two domains,  an anchoring transmembrane domain and a transcription factor region containing multiple nuclear localization signals and a fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain. Heterozygous deletion,  homozygous deletion,  and reconstructed strains of CaUPC2 as well as the parental strain were tested against several antifungal drugs,  including ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors.

Fine metabolic control is a highly responsive,  energy-saving process that is mediated by allosteric inhibition\/activation and\/or reversible modification of preexisting metabolic enzymes. In contrast,  coarse metabolic control is a relatively long-term and expensive process that involves modulating the level of metabolic enzymes. Coarse metabolic control can be achieved through the degradation of metabolic enzymes by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS),  in which substrates are specifically ubiquitinated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase and targeted for proteasomal degradation. Here,  we review select multi-protein E3 ligase complexes that directly regulate metabolic enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first part of the review focuses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated Hrd1 and Doa10 E3 ligase complexes. In addition to their primary roles in the ER-associated degradation pathway that eliminates misfolded proteins,  recent quantitative proteomic analyses identified native substrates of Hrd1 and Doa10 in the sterol synthesis pathway. The second part focuses on the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex,  an abundant prototypical multi-protein E3 ligase complex. While the best-known roles of the SCF complex are in the regulation of the cell cycle and transcription,  accumulating evidence indicates that the SCF complex also modulates carbon metabolism pathways. The increasing number of metabolic enzymes whose stability is directly regulated by the UPS underscores the importance of the proteolytic regulation of metabolic processes for the acclimation of cells to environmental changes.

We have determined that ERG11 message levels increase during growth on glucose,  in the presence of heme,  and during oxygen limiting growth conditions and,  unexpectedly,  during anaerobic growth. To determine the cis-acting regions responsible for regulation of expression of the ERG11 promoter under optimal conditions of fermentative growth,  deletion analysis was performed using the Escherichia coli lacZ as a reporter gene. Two upstream activating sequences,  UAS1 and UAS2,  and an upstream repressor element,  URS1,  plus a second possible or cryptic repressor element,  URS2,  were identified in the ERG11 promoter. The HAP1 protein product apparently participates in activation from UAS1 but not from UAS2. Sequences resembling ERG11 UAS2 were identified in seven additional oxygen-regulated genes.

Both factors together with Hog1 are required to rapidly and transiently shut down transcription of ERG2 and ERG11 upon osmoshock. Mot3 abundance and its binding to the ERG2 promoter is stimulated by osmostress in a Hog1-dependent manner.

In both free and trimethylsilylated forms,  this metabolite showed a relative retention time (relative to lanosterol) of 1.10 in gas chromatography on OV-17 columns. Comparison of its mass spectrum and retention time with those of lanosterol and 4, 4-dimethylzymosterol (4, 4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8, 24-dien-3 beta-ol) indicated that the metabolite was 4, 4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8, 14, 24-trien-3 beta-ol. Upon aerobic incubation of microsomes from semianaerobically grown yeast cells in the presence of NADPH and cyanide,  endogenous lanosterol was converted to 4, 4-dimethylzymosterol. This metabolism was inhibited by CO,  metyrapone,  SKF-525A,  and antibodies to P-450(14)DM. It is concluded that in yeast microsomes lanosterol is 14 alpha-demethylated by a P-450(14)DM-containing monooxygenase system to give rise to 4, 4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholesta-8, 14, 24-trien-3 beta-ol,  which is then reduced to 4, 4-dimethylzymosterol by an NADPH-linked reductase.

For the transcription factor Swi6,  the top hotspot by P-value contains MSB2 and ERG11 - known Swi6 target genes on different chromosomes. We verify this finding in a number of ways. First,  this top hotspot is relatively stable under PRIM across parameter settings. Second,  this hotspot is among the top hotspots by mean outcome identified by an alternative algorithm,  k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) regression. Third,  the distance between MSB2 and ERG11 is smaller than expected (by resampling) in two other 3D reconstructions generated via different normalization and reconstruction algorithms.

Upon reduction with sodium dithionite,  the azole complexes of ferric P-45014DM were converted to the corresponding ferrous derivatives. Spectral analysis of these complexes suggested that geometric orientation of the azole moiety of an antifungal agent to the ferrous heme iron was regulated by the interaction between the N-1 substituent and the heme environment. CO could not readily replace ketoconazole or itraconazole co-ordinating to the heme iron of ferrous P-45014DM while triadimefon and triadimenol complexes of the cytochrome were promptly converted to the CO complexes.

Novel approaches to characterize the mechanism of action of antifungal agents will be of great use in the antifungal drug development process.

Microarray analysis indicated differential expression of 0.8,  4.1,  3.0,  and 2.6% of the genes represented on the Affymetrix S98 yeast gene array in response to ketoconazole,  amphotericin B,  caspofungin,  and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC),  respectively. Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to confirm the microarray analyses. Genes responsive to ketoconazole,  caspofungin,  and 5-FC were indicative of the drug-specific effects. Ketoconazole exposure primarily affected genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and sterol uptake; caspofungin exposure affected genes involved in cell wall integrity; and 5-FC affected genes involved in DNA and protein synthesis,  DNA damage repair,  and cell cycle control. In contrast,  amphotericin B elicited changes in gene expression reflecting cell stress,  membrane reconstruction,  transport,  phosphate uptake,  and cell wall integrity. Genes with the greatest specificity for a particular drug were grouped together as drug-specific genes,  whereas genes with a lack of drug specificity were also identified. Taken together,  these data shed new light on the mechanisms of action of these classes of antifungal agents and demonstrate the potential utility of gene expression profiling in antifungal drug development.

In this study,  we explored a framework that unifies knowledge mining and data mining towards the goal. The framework consists of the following automated processes:  1) applying an ontology-driven knowledge mining approach to identify functional modules among the genes responding to a perturbation in order to reveal potential signals affected by the perturbation; 2) applying a graph-based data mining approach to search for perturbations that affect a common signal; and 3) revealing the architecture of a signaling system by organizing signaling units into a hierarchy based on their relationships. Applying this framework to a compendium of yeast perturbation-response data,  we have successfully recovered many well-known signal transduction pathways; in addition,  our analysis has led to many new hypotheses regarding the yeast signal transduction system; finally,  our analysis automatically organized perturbed genes as a graph reflecting the architecture of the yeast signaling system. Importantly,  this framework transformed molecular findings from a gene level to a conceptual level,  which can be readily translated into computable knowledge in the form of rules regarding the yeast signaling system,  such as \"if genes involved in the MAPK signaling are perturbed,  genes involved in pheromone responses will be differentially expressed.\" "} , { "attrname": "MeSH", "value": "[Signal Transduction,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins,  Data Mining,  Knowledge,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  Systems Biology]"} , { "attrname": "AUTHORS", "value": "[Songjian Lu,  Bo Jin,  L Ashley Cowart,  Xinghua Lu]"} ], "id": "262", "contexts": { } , "evidences": ["Imported from database"], "value": "PMID: 23637789", "ofType": "Publication", "coaccessions": [{ "elementOf": "NLM", "accession": "23637789"} ]} , { "annotation": "", "conames": [{ "name": "PMID: 15917573", "isPreferred": "true"} ], "elementOf": "NLM: SGD", "description": "", "pid": "15917573", "attributes": [{ "attrname": "JOURNAL_REF", "value": "Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy"} , { "attrname": "Chemical", "value": "[Sterols,  EC 2.7.11.13 PKC1 protein,  S cerevisiae,  1J05Z83K3M Lanosterol,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins,  79-62-9 lanostenol,  Antifungal Agents,  EC 2.7.11.13 Protein Kinase C]"} , { "attrname": "YEAR", "value": "2005"} , { "attrname": "AbstractHeader", "value": "Utilization of target-specific,  hypersensitive strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine the mode of action of antifungal compounds."} , { "attrname": "Abstract", "value": "Target-specific hypersusceptible strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used to screen antifungal compounds.

These observations indicated that 7-oxo-DHL interacted with the substrate site of cytochrome P-45014DM. However,  7-oxo-DHL was not metabolized by the reconstituted system. Incubation of 7-oxo-DHL with the reconstituted system caused accumulation of oxyferro intermediate of cytochrome P-45014DM. It can thus be concluded that 7-oxo-DHL interfered with electron transfer to the oxyferro intermediate of the cytochrome,  though it stimulated reduction of the heme iron. So far as we know,  7-oxo-DHL is the first example of a cytochrome P-450 inhibitor which selectively interferes with the electron transfer to oxyferro intermediate. 7 alpha-Hydroxy-24, 25-dihydrolanosterol was also a competitive inhibitor of cytochrome P-45014DM.

Here we present data to further the understanding of the role of heme in the proper biological functioning of Dap1p in cellular processes. First,  we examined the role of Dap1p in stabilizing the P450 enzyme,  Erg11p,  a key regulatory protein in ergosterol biosynthesis. Our data indicate that the absence of Dap1p does not affect Erg11p mRNA,  protein expression levels,  or the protein degradation rates in S. Cerevisaie. Second,  in order to probe the role of heme in the biological functioning of Dap1p,  we measured ferric and ferrous heme binding affinities for Dap1p and the mutant Dap1pY138F,  as well as equilibrium midpoint reduction potentials of the Fe(III)\/Fe(II) couples. Our results show that both wild-type and mutant proteins bind heme in a 1: 1 fashion,  possessing tight ferric heme affinities,  KD values of 400 pM and 200 nM,  respectively,  but exhibiting weak ferrous affinities,  2 and 10 microM,  respectively. Additionally,  the measured reduction potential of Dap1p,  which was found to be -307 mV,  is similar to that of other monotyrosinate hemoproteins. Although previous reports show the weaker affinity of Dap1pY138F for ferric heme lowers the production of ergosterol with respect to wild-type Dap1p in S. pombe,  we find that Dap1pY138F expression is still sufficient to rescue the growth sensitivity of dap1Delta to fluconazole and methyl methanesulfonate in S. cerevisiae. Various interpretations of these results are discussed with respect to Dap1p function in the cell.

The Bromodomain Factor 1 (Bdf1p) is a transcriptional regulator,  which is part of the basal transcription factor TFIID. Cells lacking Bdf1p are salt sensitive with an abnormal mitochondrial function. We previously reported that the overexpression of HAL2 or deletion of HDA1 lowers the salt sensitivity of bdf1?. To better understand the mechanism behind the HAL2-related response to salt stress,  we compared three global transcriptional profiles (bdf1? vs WT,  bdf1? + HAL2 vs bdf1?,  and bdf1?hda1? vs bdf1?) in response to salt stress using DNA microarrays. Our results reveal that genes for iron acquisition and cellular and mitochondrial remodeling are induced by HAL2. Overexpression of HAL2 decreases the concentration of nitric oxide. Mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly also decreases in bdf1? + HAL2. These changes are similar to the changes of transcriptional profiles induced by iron starvation. Taken together,  our data suggest that mitochondrial functions and iron homeostasis play an important role in bdf1?-induced salt sensitivity and salt stress response in yeast.

The physiological and transcriptional responses to GR changes of these cultures differed markedly from the respective responses of prototrophs whose growth-rate is regulated by the availability of natural nutrients. The data for all auxotrophs at all GRs recapitulated the features of aerobic glycolysis,  fermentation despite high oxygen levels in the growth media. In addition,  we discovered wide bimodal distributions of cell sizes,  indicating a decoupling between the cell division cycle (CDC) and biomass production. The aerobic glycolysis was reflected in a general signature of anaerobic growth,  including substantial reduction in the expression levels of mitochondrial and tricarboxylic acid genes. We also found that the magnitude of the transcriptional growth-rate response (GRR) in the auxotrophs is only 40-50% of the magnitude in prototrophs. Furthermore,  the auxotrophic cultures express autophagy genes at substantially lower levels,  which likely contributes to their lower viability. Our observations suggest that a GR signal,  which is a function of the abundance of essential natural nutrients,  regulates fermentation\/respiration,  the GRR,  and the CDC.

The physiology of eukaryotic membranes is fine-tuned by another terpenoid class,  namely sterols. Evidence is accumulating that numerous membrane proteins require specific sterol structural features for function. Moreover,  sterols are intermediates in the synthesis of steroids serving as hormones in higher eukaryotes. Like steroids many compounds of the terpenoid family do not contribute to membrane architecture,  but serve as signalling,  protective or attractant\/repellent molecules. Particularly plants have developed a plenitude of terpenoid biosynthetic routes branching off early in the sterol biosynthesis pathway and,  thereby,  forming one of the largest groups of naturally occurring organic compounds. Many of these aromatic and volatile molecules are interesting for industrial application ranging from foods to pharmaceuticals. Combining the fortunate situation that sterol biosynthesis is highly conserved in eukaryotes with the amenability of yeasts to genetic and metabolic engineering,  basically all naturally occurring terpenoids might be produced involving yeasts.
